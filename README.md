# Cairn

> A calm place to plan, reflect, and progress.

Cairn is a personal productivity app with **daily tasks**, **habit streaks**, **long-horizon goals**, **journal-style notes**, and an **AI assistant** that knows your context. Built on Next.js 16, React 19, and Tailwind v4.

**Production:** [https://assistant.alikamatu.com](https://assistant.alikamatu.com)

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alikamatu/osama.git cairn
cd cairn
cp .env.example .env.local        # fill in keys — see docs/SETUP.md
npm install
npm run dev                       # http://localhost:3000
```

You'll need accounts for Resend (email), Paystack (billing, GHS), Cloudinary (uploads), and Anthropic (Claude API). Web-push VAPID keys are generated locally with one command. See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md).
